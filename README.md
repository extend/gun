Gun
===

Gun is an asynchronous SPDY, HTTP and Websocket client.

Goals
-----

Gun aims to provide an **easy to use** client compatible with
HTTP, SPDY and Websocket.

Gun is **always connected**. It will maintain a permanent
connection to the server, reopening it as soon as the server
closes it, saving time for the requests that come in.

All connections are **supervised** automatically, allowing
developers to focus on writing their code without worrying.

Sponsors
--------

The project is currently sponsored by
[Kato.im](https://kato.im) and [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io).

The SPDY implementation was sponsored by
[LeoFS Cloud Storage](http://www.leofs.org).
